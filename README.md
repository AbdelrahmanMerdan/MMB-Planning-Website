The creation of the MMB Planning website was driven by a profound sense of purpose, particularly due to its association with a startup architecture firm. As the sole developer and designer, I undertook the task of not only constructing the website but also crafting the logo and front-end design elements.

Working in tandem with the startup's vision, I meticulously designed a modern and professional logo that encapsulated MMB Planning's essence. The logo serves as a visual representation of the firm's commitment to innovation and precision in architectural planning.

The website itself was developed using React, TypeScript, and CSS, with a focus on creating a user-friendly and informative platform. Every front-end design element was carefully chosen to convey the professionalism and contemporary nature of MMB Planning's services. This website not only elevates the startup's online presence but also provides a seamless avenue for potential clients to explore their portfolio and expertise. In essence, it serves as a powerful tool to establish and promote the firm's presence in the architectural field.

Creating the MMB Planning website was a thoughtful journey where design and development came together seamlessly. The site was carefully constructed using React, TypeScript, and CSS, allowing for an interactive and responsive user interface. The TypeScript added structure and reliability to the codebase, while CSS was instrumental in crafting a modern, visually appealing design. As the sole designer and developer, I also took charge of crafting the logo and front-end design elements, ensuring they aligned perfectly with MMB Planning's professional image. The combination of these elements resulted in a website that not only reflects the startup's ethos but also offers a user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing experience for visitors.
